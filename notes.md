=========================

Migrated jupyter notebook prototype to python script and used datreant to 
store checkpoints. No metadata being stored now.

Andrea's solutions don't look like mine. It appears she's solving 
Laplace's equation, as the charge resulting from the decomposed 
concentration field doesn't seem to be reflected in the potential. 
Conversely, the potential BCs do seem to affect the CH solution, so hers
is not completely decoupled.
